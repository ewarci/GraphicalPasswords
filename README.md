# Graphical Passwords

As part of a project on graphical passwords on smartphones, we implemented a number of graphical password schemes for Android. 
We used these implementations for our study in the following paper:

>  Schaub, F., Walch, M., Könings, B., & Weber, M. (2013, July).<br>
>  [Exploring the design space of graphical passwords on smartphones](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2501615).<br>
>  In Proceedings of the Ninth Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (p. 11). ACM.<br>
>  [[PDF]](http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/soups/2013/proceedings/a11_Schaub.pdf)

We provide our implementations to the research and mobile developer communities to facilitate replication of research results and encoruage the use of graphical password schemes.

The different schemes have been implemented according to the respective descriptions in the original papers listed below. Please acknowledge us by citing our SOUPS paper when you make use of our implementations, and cite or and acknowledge the creators when referring to the respective schemes.
